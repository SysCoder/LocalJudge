# Local Judge

**Local Judge** is an open source, in browser, offline(no internet required) code judge. Problems are sourced from [Elements of Programming Interviews book](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge).

You can download Local Judge to your computer and run the page locally without an internet connection.

You can find a demo [here](https://syscoder.github.io/LocalJudge/pages/index.html).

It is currently super slow. I believe there are ways this can be improved.
